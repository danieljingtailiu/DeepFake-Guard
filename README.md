# DeepFake-Guard

People are increasingly using deepfakes for harmful purposes:

1. Faking identity to apply for remote jobs
2. Impersonating others in video calls
3. Spreading political misinformation
4. Creating non-consensual explicit content

This project uses deep learning to detect deepfakes.

Work in progress...
